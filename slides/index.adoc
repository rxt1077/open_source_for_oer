== Philosophy

[quote,Mahatma Gandhi]
The means are the ends in the making.

== Free Software

* Freedom to: run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve
* Open source is a precondition to this
* Equitable and inclusive by design

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== A little bit of history


[.column]
image::bell_labs.jpg[]

[.column]
* NJ is the birthplace of UNIX!
* Distributed for free (but couldn't be modified)
* _Good_ documentation and collaboration made _great_ software

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== Linux

[.column]
* Most popular operating system kernel 
* Largest open source project ever
* Over 14,000 developers
* Powering the cloud, in your pocket, and orbiting the earth!

[.column]

=== How is it done?

* Version control: cvs, svn, git
* Public mailing lists, Discord channels
* Hosting/Project Management: SourceForge, GitHub, SourceHut
* Open conventions and codes of conduct

=== Emergent Patterns

* Steep learning curve, lots of documentation
* Participatory, inclusive communities
* WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean)
* DRY (don't repeat yourself)
* Separate content and style 

== Open Source Tools

== Text Processing and Publishing

* latexmath:[\LaTeX]
* Markdown
* Asciidoctor

[.columns]
=== latexmath:[\LaTeX]

[.column]
latexmath:[\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_o}] +
latexmath:[\nabla \cdot B = 0] + 
latexmath:[\nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}] +
latexmath:[\nabla \times B = \mu_o(J + \epsilon_o \frac{\partial E}{\partial t})]

[.column]
* Oldest, but still very common
* Meant for the printed page
* Beautiful math notation

=== Example

[source, latex]
----
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{amsmath}

\title{Simple Sample}
\author{My Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    
    \section{Hello World!}
    
    \textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX.
     \LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$ %$ tells LaTexX to compile as math
     . I can also give equations their own space: 
    \begin{equation}
    \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
    \end{equation}
    If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).  
    Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
     \LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.
    
    For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== Markdown

[.column]
* Simple to write and read
* Currently very popular
* Mainly intended for HTML output

[.column]
image::markdown.png[]

=== Example

[source, markdown]
----
# Hello World!

Markdown is designed to be simple to read even if it isn't converted to HTML.
If you want a new paragraph, you can make one by putting in a blank line.

Like this!

Lists are supported too:
* Unordered lists (like this)
* And ordered ones (with a number and a period)
----

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== Asciidoctor

[.column]
image::asciidoctor.png[]

[.column]
* Consistent and standardized
* Great functionality
* Still readable

=== Example

[source, asciidoc]
----
= Headings start with equals signs

Paragraphs are still separated by newlines

https://asciidoctor.org[Links are unambiguous]

[source,python]
print("Code blocks are easy")
----

=== Commonalities

* Write plain text but _generate_ HTML, PDF, ePub, etc.
* Reach Goal: Readability (required for collaboration)
* Reach Goal: Open and documented standards and tools

== Collaborative Editing

* Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
* Subversion (SVN)
* Git

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== cvs

[.column]
[plantuml]
....
@startuml
rectangle "Repository" as repo
rectangle "Working Copy 1" as wc1
rectangle "Working Copy 2" as wc2
rectangle "Working Copy 3" as wc3

repo --> wc1 : update
wc1 --> repo : commit
repo --> wc2 : update
wc2 --> repo : commit
repo --> wc3 : update
wc3 --> repo : commit
@enduml
....

[.column]
* Designed to work with students on large projects
* Works with directories full of text files
* Centralized by design

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== Subversion 

[.column]
* Similar concept to CVS
* Many optimizations
* More options

[.column]
image::svn.svg[]

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== Git

[.column]
image::git.png[]

[.column]
* Written by Linus Torvalds
* _Distributed_ version control
* Don't do things the CVS way!

=== Commonalities

* Not real time!
* Command line programs
* Track changes and be reversible

== Hosting / Project Management

* SourceForge
* GitHub
* SourceHut

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== SourceForge

[.column]
image::sf.png[]

[.column]
* Free hosting for open source projects
* Revision control system / Bug Tracking / Wiki
* Easier collaboration than mailing lists

[.columns.is-vcentered]
=== GitHub

[.column]
* Emphasis on git
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
* Fork based pull requests (PRs)

[.column]
image::github.png[]

=== SourceHut

image::sourcehut.png[]

* Opinionated: https://man.sr.ht/~renerocksai/migrate-to-sourcehut/PR.md[back to the email workflow]
* Simple: no JavaScript, basic layout
* Open source, participatory
